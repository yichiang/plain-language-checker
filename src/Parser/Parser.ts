const textDemo = `I focused on tools for learning programming. The tools for learning programming are useful to attract young people and teach them how to program. Teaching young people to program is important to motivate them to go after a computer science career. As a result, more and more schools are teaching students how to program.
Most of the tools for learning programming are blocks-based. Blocks-based programming environments rely on vision a lot. Students need to see so they can write a program and look at the result. Students who are blind or low-vision are at a disadvantage since they may not see what they need to use block-based programming environments.
The article summarized below describes how the authors created the Blocks4All app. The authors of the article did a study with 5 blind or low-vision (BLV) kids and a teacher of the visually impaired (TVI). In the study, the authors describe problems they found in existing programming environments for BLV kids. The authors created an app called Blocks4All which tries to fix these problems and make programming accessible for all.`;
